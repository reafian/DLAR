This is the stuff that's in this repo.

1. DLAR_uploader.sh - A script that kind of ran away with itself to ensure the data delivered is correct with reporting too.

## DLAR_uploader.sh

Lots of validation on incoming source files. The script tries to ensure that the delivered data is internally consistent but also doesn't deviate too much from what was delivered previously.  It also does delivery validation and reporting.
